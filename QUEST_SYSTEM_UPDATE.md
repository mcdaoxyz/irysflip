# Quest System Update - Smart Contract Only

## Overview
The quest system has been completely updated to use only smart contract data, removing all local storage dependencies. This ensures that quest progress is always accurate and synchronized with the blockchain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Local Storage Dependencies
- All quest data is now fetched directly from the smart contract
- No more local storage for quest progress tracking
- Automatic clearing of any existing local quest data

### 2. Automatic Quest Tracking
- Daily flips are automatically tracked through the smart contract
- No manual recording of flips needed
- Quest completion is determined by smart contract state

### 3. Real-time Data
- Quest status refreshes automatically every 30 seconds
- All quest progress is live from the blockchain
- No more sync issues between local and contract data

## Key Features
